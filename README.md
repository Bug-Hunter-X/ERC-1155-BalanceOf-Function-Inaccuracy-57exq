# ERC-1155 BalanceOf Function Inaccuracy

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dapps that implement the ERC-1155 standard. The `balanceOf` function, as written, only returns the balance for a single token ID, ignoring the fact that ERC-1155 allows for multiple token IDs. This can lead to significant inaccuracies in balance calculations.  The solution demonstrates the correct implementation of the `balanceOf` function according to the ERC-1155 specifications.

## Bug
The provided Solidity code for the `balanceOf` function lacks support for multiple token IDs, returning only the balance of a single token ID. This violates the ERC-1155 standard which supports multiple token types.

## Solution
The corrected code includes a loop which iterates over all the tokenIds of the user. This ensures that all tokens owned by the user are accounted for.
